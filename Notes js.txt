console.log("Getting a new laptop!");

Data types:

To create a variable use [keyword] [name]

Keyword can be 'let' or 'var'. Use let as its newer and gives a block scope to variable 

Eg:
let variable;
variable = 123;

You can write JavaScript right in your browser. Open a browser window and navigate to Developer Tools.
In the console, you will find a prompt; type let myVariable = 123,
press return, then type myVariable. What happens? Note, you'll learn more about these concepts in subsequent lessons.

Constants are declared using 'const' and variable name is in all caps. 
Constants must be initialized in same line, Cant change value of reference. 

Not allowed:
const obj = {a:3};
obj = {b:5};

Allowed:
const obj = {a:3};
obj.a = 5;
Above you are changing the value of the object but not the reference itself, which makes it allowed.

Data types aka Data primitives
String, number, bigint, boolean, undefined, symbol. 

Can concatenate strings using + or `

let myString1 = "Hello";
let myString2 = "World";

myString1 + myString2;

`${myString1} ${myString2}!`


Functions and Methods:

function nameOfFunction(para1,para2,para3) { // function definition
 // function definition/body
}

// calling our function
displayGreeting();

Function in a function

function displayDone() {
  console.log('3 seconds has elapsed');
}
// timer value is in milliseconds
setTimeout(displayDone, 3000);

setTimeout(function() {
  console.log('3 seconds has elapsed');
}, 3000);

More efficient

Fat arrow functions: Use => instead of function keyword

setTimeout(() => {
  console.log('3 seconds has elapsed');
}, 3000);

You've now seen we have three ways to pass a function as a parameter and might be wondering when to use each. If you know you'll be using the function more than once, create it as normal. If you'll be using it for just the one location, it's generally best to use an anonymous function. Whether or not you use a fat arrow function or the more traditional function syntax is up to you, but you will notice most modern developers prefer =>.


You've seen so far how if you can use an if...else statement to create conditional logic. Anything that goes into an if needs to evaluate to true/false. By using the ! operator you can negate the expression. It would look like so:

if (!condition) {
  // runs if condition is false
} else {
  // runs if condition is true
}

Ternary Expression

let variable = condition ? <return this if true> : <return this if false>

Arrays:

Don't have to specify length in start

let arr = [];
arr.length;

There are forEach, for-of, and map. Read on these techniques.

The forEach() method executes a provided function once for each array element.

Foreach():

const array1 = ['a', 'b', 'c'];

array1.forEach(element => console.log(element));

For(of)
The for...of statement creates a loop iterating over iterable objects,

const array1 = ['a', 'b', 'c'];

for (const element of array1) {
  console.log(element);
}

The map() method creates a new array populated with the results of calling a provided function on every element in the calling array.

const array1 = [1, 4, 9, 16];

// pass a function to map
const map1 = array1.map(x => x * 2);

console.log(map1);
